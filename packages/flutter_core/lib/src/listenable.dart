/// An object that maintains a list of listeners.
///
/// The listeners are typically used to notify clients that the object has been
/// updated.
///
/// There are two variants of this interface:
///
///  * [ValueListenable], an interface that augments the [Listenable] interface
///    with the concept of a _current value_.
///
///  * [Animation], an interface that augments the [ValueListenable] interface
///    to add the concept of direction (forward or reverse).
///
/// Many classes in the Flutter API use or implement these interfaces. The
/// following subclasses are especially relevant:
///
///  * [ChangeNotifier], which can be subclassed or mixed in to create objects
///    that implement the [Listenable] interface.
///
///  * [ValueNotifier], which implements the [ValueListenable] interface with
///    a mutable value that triggers the notifications when modified.
///
/// The terms "notify clients", "send notifications", "trigger notifications",
/// and "fire notifications" are used interchangeably.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [AnimatedBuilder], a widget that uses a builder callback to rebuild
///    whenever a given [Listenable] triggers its notifications. This widget is
///    commonly used with [Animation] subclasses, hence its name, but is by no
///    means limited to animations, as it can be used with any [Listenable]. It
///    is a subclass of [AnimatedWidget], which can be used to create widgets
///    that are driven from a [Listenable].
///  * [ValueListenableBuilder], a widget that uses a builder callback to
///    rebuild whenever a [ValueListenable] object triggers its notifications,
///    providing the builder with the value of the object.
///  * [InheritedNotifier], an abstract superclass for widgets that use a
///    [Listenable]'s notifications to trigger rebuilds in descendant widgets
///    that declare a dependency on them, using the [InheritedWidget] mechanism.
///  * [Listenable.merge], which creates a [Listenable] that triggers
///    notifications whenever any of a list of other [Listenable]s trigger their
///    notifications.
