// TODO(louisehsu): Replace this empty file with PointerInterceptorIOS Implementation.

/***=
 *  This file is a temporary solution as this allows existing usages of PointerInterceptor
 *  on iOS to maintain their no-op behaviour. Eventually, this file will be replaced with the
 *  iOS implementation of pointer_interceptor.
 *
 *  Please note this no-op behavior is being deprecated soon, so developers should remove
 *  the widget from mobile. If you wish to instead opt-in to the new iOS implementation,
 *  please include both pointer_interceptor_ios and pointer_interceptor in your pubspec.yaml
