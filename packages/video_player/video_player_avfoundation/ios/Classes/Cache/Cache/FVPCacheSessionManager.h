/**
* `FVPCacheSessionManager` is a singleton class responsible for managing the download operations related to caching media content. It provides a shared instance for coordinating download tasks, ensuring controlled concurrent downloads within the application.

*  Usage:
*  1. Access the shared instance of `FVPCacheSessionManager` using the `shared` class method.
*  2. Enqueue download operations using the `downloadQueue` property.

*  Example:
*  // Access the shared instance of FVPCacheSessionManager
*  FVPCacheSessionManager *cacheManager = [FVPCacheSessionManager shared];

*  // Create and enqueue a download operation
*  NSOperation *downloadOperation = [NSBlockOperation blockOperationWithBlock:^{
*      // Perform the download operation here
*  }];
*  [cacheManager.downloadQueue addOperation:downloadOperation];
* @warning It is recommended to use the shared instance for download operations to ensure efficient resource utilization and control over concurrent downloads.
*
* @see NSOperationQueue
