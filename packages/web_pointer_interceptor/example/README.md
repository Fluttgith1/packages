# web_pointer_interceptor

A small example for the PointerInterceptor widget.

## Getting Started

`flutter run -d chrome` to run the sample. You can tweak some code in the `lib/main.dart`, but be careful, changes there can break integration tests!

## Running tests

`flutter drive --target integration_test/widget_test.dart --driver test_driver/integration_test.dart --show-web-server-device -d web-server`

The command above will run the integration tests for this package.
